# Architecture Analysis Report

## Model Architecture Overview

The evaluated model uses an **independent task heads** architecture design, which was implemented to address the critical issues found with the original unified head design.

### Key Architecture Components

1. **Backbone**: MobileNetV3-Small
   - Pretrained on ImageNet
   - 2.54M parameters
   - Multi-scale feature extraction (4 scales)

2. **Neck**: Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
   - 0.61M parameters
   - Feature fusion across scales
   - Output channels: 128

3. **Task Heads**: Independent heads for each task
   - **Segmentation**: Dedicated decoder with transposed convolutions
   - **Detection**: FCOS-style anchor-free head
   - **Classification**: Separate global pooling and FC layers

### Architecture Advantages

1. **Task Isolation**: Each task has its own dedicated processing path, preventing gradient interference
2. **Flexibility**: Different architectures can be optimized for each task
3. **Training Stability**: No shared layers means no conflicting gradients
4. **Better Task Balance**: Each task can learn at its own pace

### Comparison with Original Unified Head

| Aspect | Unified Head (Original) | Independent Heads (Current) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Gradient Interference | Severe | None |
| Task Balance | Poor | Better |
| Training Complexity | High | Lower |
| Parameter Efficiency | Higher | Lower |
| Performance | Failed | Improved |

## Performance Analysis

### Current Results
- **Classification**: 15.0% (Target: ≥70%) ❌
- **Segmentation**: Not evaluated yet
- **Detection**: Not evaluated yet

### Classification Performance Breakdown
- Only classes 3, 7, and 8 show any correct predictions
- Most classes have 0% accuracy
- Indicates severe underfitting or training issues

## Root Cause Analysis

Despite the architectural improvements, the model still shows poor performance, particularly in classification. Possible reasons:

1. **Insufficient Training**: The joint training may need more epochs or different hyperparameters
2. **Learning Rate Issues**: The fixed learning rate (1e-3) might be too high/low for certain tasks
3. **Data Imbalance**: Some classes might be underrepresented
4. **Feature Quality**: The shared backbone features might not be suitable for all tasks
5. **Task Weight Imbalance**: The dynamic task weighting might not be working effectively

## Recommendations for Phase 4-2 (Optimization)

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Use different learning rates for different tasks
   - Implement learning rate scheduling
   - Adjust task weights based on validation performance

2. **Training Strategy Improvements**
   - Longer training with early stopping
   - Task-specific warmup periods
   - Gradient clipping for stability

3. **Architecture Refinements**
   - Add task-specific feature adaptation layers
   - Implement attention mechanisms for better feature selection
   - Consider task-specific backbone fine-tuning

4. **Data Augmentation**
   - Task-specific augmentations
   - Mixup/CutMix for classification
   - Copy-paste augmentation for detection

5. **Loss Function Improvements**
   - Label smoothing for classification
   - Focal loss variants for imbalanced classes
   - Auxiliary losses for better feature learning
