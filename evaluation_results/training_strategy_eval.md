# Training Strategy Evaluation

## Joint Training Strategy Analysis

### Strategy Overview

The model was trained using a **joint training strategy** with three phases:

1. **Warmup Phase (5 epochs)**: Individual task training
2. **Joint Training Phase (40 epochs)**: Simultaneous training of all tasks
3. **Fine-tuning Phase (5 epochs)**: Balanced performance optimization

### Key Components

1. **Dynamic Task Weighting**
   - Automatic adjustment based on loss magnitudes
   - Prevents any single task from dominating
   - Formula: `weight_i = (avg_loss / task_loss_i)^0.5`

2. **High Learning Rate**
   - Fixed at 1e-3 throughout training
   - No learning rate decay
   - Same rate for all tasks

3. **No Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention**
   - EWC was removed after proving ineffective
   - Relies on joint training to maintain performance

### Training Results Analysis

Based on the training logs from PROJECT_STATUS_BACKUP.md:

```
Final Epoch (50/50):
- Segmentation Loss: 1.1234
- Detection Loss: 4.5678  
- Classification Loss: 2.3012
- Task Weights: [0.89, 1.23, 0.92]
```

### Effectiveness Assessment

#### Positive Aspects
1. **Completed Training**: The model trained for all 50 epochs without crashes
2. **Loss Convergence**: All task losses decreased during training
3. **Stable Weights**: Task weights remained relatively balanced
4. **No Catastrophic Forgetting**: Joint training prevented complete task failure

#### Negative Aspects
1. **Poor Final Performance**: 
   - Classification: 15% (near random for 10 classes)
   - Segmentation: 36.65% mIoU
   - Detection: 50% mAP (only task meeting target)

2. **Learning Rate Issues**:
   - Fixed high learning rate may have prevented fine convergence
   - No task-specific learning rates

3. **Insufficient Epochs**:
   - 50 epochs may not be enough for multi-task learning
   - No early stopping based on validation performance

### Comparison: Sequential vs Joint Training

| Aspect | Sequential Training | Joint Training |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Catastrophic Forgetting | Severe (>90% drop) | None |
| Training Complexity | Low | Medium |
| Task Balance | Poor | Better |
| Final Performance | Failed completely | Partial success |
| Training Time | Faster per task | Slower overall |

### Task Balance Analysis

The dynamic weighting shows:
- Segmentation: Weight 0.89 (slightly underweighted)
- Detection: Weight 1.23 (overweighted due to higher loss)
- Classification: Weight 0.92 (nearly balanced)

This suggests the weighting mechanism is working but may need refinement.

### Key Findings

1. **Joint Training > Sequential Training**: Clear improvement over catastrophic forgetting
2. **Dynamic Weighting Helps**: But needs better tuning
3. **Learning Rate Critical**: Fixed rate limits performance
4. **More Training Needed**: 50 epochs insufficient for convergence

## Recommendations for Optimization

1. **Extended Training**
   - Train for 100-200 epochs
   - Implement early stopping on validation set
   - Save best checkpoint per task

2. **Learning Rate Schedule**
   - Cosine annealing or step decay
   - Task-specific learning rates
   - Lower final learning rate (1e-5)

3. **Improved Task Weighting**
   - Use validation performance for weights
   - Add momentum to weight updates
   - Consider uncertainty-based weighting

4. **Warmup Refinement**
   - Longer warmup (10-15 epochs)
   - Gradual transition to joint training
   - Task-specific warmup lengths

5. **Loss Function Improvements**
   - Add auxiliary losses
   - Use label smoothing
   - Implement focal loss variants
